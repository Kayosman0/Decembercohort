    <h2> Short introduction about myself</h2>

    <h6> My name is kafiya and i am 24 years old of age, based in the West Midlands. <br> I am a recent psychology degree graduate. After many years of being interested in computer programming <br> I finally took the first step to sign myself up for a bootcamp. <br>A random fact about me is that I love travelling. <br> Within this year I have been lucky to travel to 5 countries. <br>I am very excited for this new journey of coding which i am enjoying so far. </h6>
